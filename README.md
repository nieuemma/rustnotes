# nieuemma's Rust Notes
## You might notice that all this information seems a lot like what is in the official rust books.
## It is. That's what I am taking notes from. I am reading the official documentation and slimming it down to nice notes I can study from and check when I need a reminder.
- This is set up to be and mdbook, just like "The Rust Programming Language", the official Rust book. You can just look at the markdown files on their own if you'd prefer to not serve the mdbook and read from your browser.
